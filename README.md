# Extreme-Pong
A simple and fun pong game with customization options. My first project ever developed. You can also find it on Google Play Store under the name of ["Extreme Pong"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.expong2.game&hl=en).
</br>
</br>
It was developed using Java and the LibGdx game engine in Android Studio as my final project for high school.
